This is not my creation. The credit goes to krkeegan with the original plans.
I have tweaked some of the setting to allow for better clearance. I took the 
basic measurements and created the Onshape file here:

I also have included all of the files so that you can pick up anywhere in the
project. 
Settings: 0.25in router bit, clearance is .15 in, and step down is .12 in. Obviously measurement are in
inches. The wood is set at a .448 in thickness. I recommend using thicker wood and sanding it to fit. I used
wood glue to bond it and brad nails to secure it. I also cut grooves in mine to hold the rubber band. 
Enjoy!
